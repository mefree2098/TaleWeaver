## Core Data Context Issues

### Context Persistence
- **Issue**: Changes to characters not persisting between view transitions
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient context management and refresh handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented CoreDataManager with proper context handling
  - Added context refresh methods
  - Added object refresh capabilities
  - Improved save handling with error logging

### Data Consistency
- **Issue**: Character data becoming stale or inconsistent
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proper context refresh after modifications
- **Solution**:
  - Added context refresh on view appear/disappear
  - Implemented object refresh after edits
  - Added immediate save after modifications
  - Improved error handling for failed operations

## Prevention Measures
1. Always refresh context when views appear/disappear
2. Refresh objects after modifications
3. Save changes immediately after edits
4. Log all Core Data operations for debugging
5. Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
